*Summary of section 3 of the [paper](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf).*

The **Lakehouse architecture** combines the benefits of **data lakes** (low-cost storage, open file formats) with the management and performance features of **data warehouses** (ACID transactions, data versioning, indexing, etc.). The key challenge is integrating these benefits without sacrificing separation of storage and compute.

### Implementing a Lakehouse System

- **Low-Cost Storage with Metadata Layer**: Data is stored in low-cost object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) in open formats (e.g., Parquet). A **transactional metadata layer** provides features like ACID transactions, versioning, and efficient management. Systems like **Delta Lake** and **Apache Iceberg** already use this approach.
  
- **Optimizing SQL Performance**: Achieving state-of-the-art SQL performance requires additional features such as **caching**, **indexes**, and **data layout optimizations**. These techniques optimize query performance without changing the underlying data format.

- **Declarative APIs for Advanced Analytics**: **DataFrame APIs** offer a declarative way for machine learning and data science workloads to benefit from Lakehouse optimizations. By integrating APIs like Spark SQL, users can perform data transformations and queries more efficiently.

### Metadata Layers for Data Management

The **metadata layer** is key to enabling advanced data management on data lakes. Systems like **Delta Lake** and **Apache Iceberg** offer ACID transactions, time travel, schema enforcement, and access control, making data lakes more reliable and easier to manage. These systems allow for fast adoption by converting existing Parquet files into managed Lakehouse tables with no data duplication.

### SQL Performance in a Lakehouse

**SQL performance** in a Lakehouse is improved through several techniques:

1. **Caching**: Frequently accessed data can be cached on faster devices like SSDs or RAM to speed up queries.
2. **Auxiliary Data**: Indexes, statistics, and other auxiliary data structures help optimize query execution, allowing data skipping and faster lookups.
3. **Data Layout**: Techniques like **Z-ordering** improve the physical organization of data, ensuring better performance for common query patterns.

### Efficient Access for Advanced Analytics

Lakehouses support **advanced analytics** by providing efficient data access for **machine learning (ML)** and **data science** workloads. **Declarative DataFrame APIs** allow systems like **TensorFlow** and **Spark MLlib** to take advantage of Lakehouse features like caching and data skipping. Optimized data access layers ensure that ML workloads can process large datasets efficiently.

The **Lakehouse** design offers a unified architecture that provides the performance and management benefits of data warehouses while maintaining the flexibility and low cost of data lakes. With improvements in metadata management, SQL performance, and advanced analytics integration, the Lakehouse is positioned as the next evolution in data management systems.
