Data validation is the process of checking if a dataset meets certain criteria, ensuring it is suitable for tasks like modeling or visualization. It verifies data against logical and statistical assumptions.

### The Validation Function

A validation function can be expressed simply as:

`v(x) â†’ {True, False}`

Where `v` is the function, and `x` is the data. If the dataset meets the criteria, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Types of Validation Rules

1. **Technical Validation Rules**: These check basic data structure, types, uniqueness, and nullability.  
   *Example*: Ensure the "age" field contains only positive integers.

2. **Domain-Specific Validation Rules**: Reflect properties specific to the dataset's context.  
   *Example*: In a census dataset, "education" should be one of "high school" or "undergraduate."

### Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Validation

- **Deterministic Validation**: Uses fixed logical rules (e.g., "age > 18").  
- **Probabilistic Validation**: Incorporates uncertainty, using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to validate data properties.

Data validation ensures that errors in datasets are caught before they affect analysis, visualizations, or models. Inaccurate or inconsistent data can lead to misleading insights, which is why validation is critical.
