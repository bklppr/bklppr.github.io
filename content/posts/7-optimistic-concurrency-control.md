**Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** is a method used to ensure data consistency in systems, allowing multiple transactions to proceed without locks. Instead of preventing conflicts, OCC detects them only when a transaction is ready to commit.

1. **How OCC Works**: Transactions execute without locking data. At the commit phase, the system checks for conflicts by validating whether another transaction modified the data in the meantime. If no conflicts are found, the transaction commits; otherwise, it's rolled back.  
    *Example*: Two users editing the same document can work independently, and only at the save point does the system check for conflicts.

2. **Key Differences Between OCC and Pessimistic Concurrency Control**:  
    - **OCC** allows transactions to execute without holding locks, relying on conflict detection at commit time.  
    - **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**, by contrast, locks data as soon as a transaction starts, preventing other transactions from accessing the same data until the first one completes.  
    *Example*: In pessimistic control, two users editing the same document would be forced to wait for one another.

OCC is particularly beneficial in distributed systems with low contention, as it allows for higher parallelism and reduces the overhead caused by locking.
