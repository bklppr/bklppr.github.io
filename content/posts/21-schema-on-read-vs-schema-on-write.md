### What is Schema-on-Read?

**Schema-on-Read** refers to a data management approach where the schema (or structure) of the data is applied when it is read or queried, not when it is written to storage. This is the approach used in **data lakes** and similar systems that store raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data. In this model, data can be ingested in almost any format and is only interpreted or transformed into a structured format during query time.

#### Key Characteristics of Schema-on-Read:
- **Flexibility**: Since there is no enforced schema during data ingestion, this model supports a wide variety of data types, including unstructured data (e.g., logs, images, video) and structured data.
- **Late Binding**: The data schema is only applied when the data is read, allowing analysts and data scientists to decide how to interpret the data later, depending on the use case.
- **Low Ingestion Overhead**: Schema-on-Read enables fast and easy data ingestion because the data doesnâ€™t need to conform to a rigid structure during the write process.

#### Example:
In a **data lake** using **Apache Parquet** or **ORC** files, data can be dumped into the lake in raw form. When querying the data, tools like **Apache Spark** will apply the schema dynamically based on the query, which means that each query can apply different interpretations or transformations to the same data.

### What is Schema-on-Write?

**Schema-on-Write** requires that the schema be defined upfront, before the data is written to the storage system. This is the model used in traditional **data warehouses** where data is stored in a structured, highly optimized format. Before the data can be ingested, it must conform to the pre-defined schema, ensuring consistency and order in the data storage process.

#### Key Characteristics of Schema-on-Write:
- **Data Validation**: The schema is enforced during data ingestion, meaning that the data must be clean, accurate, and fit the required structure before being written. This ensures data quality from the outset.
- **Optimized for Query Performance**: Schema-on-Write systems optimize data for fast and efficient querying by organizing it in structured tables with indexes, partitions, and other optimizations.
- **Early Binding**: Because the schema is applied before the data is written, this approach is more rigid but ensures data consistency and reliability.
