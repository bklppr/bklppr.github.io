**Time travel** in data management refers to the ability to query previous versions of a dataset, enabling users to access historical data snapshots.

1. **Querying Historical Versions**: Time travel allows you to view or roll back to an earlier state of the data, typically using a timestamp or version identifier.  
    *Example*: In a retail dataset, time travel can help track inventory levels as they appeared on a specific date.

2. **Use Cases for Rollback and Historical Analysis**:  
    - **Rollback**: If an error is made in a dataset, time travel allows you to roll back to a clean version.  
    *Example*: Rolling back a database to its state before a faulty data ingestion job corrupted records.
    
    - **Historical Analysis**: Time travel is also useful for comparing past trends or running audits.  
    *Example*: Comparing last year's sales data against current data to understand market changes.

Time travel enables flexible, reliable management of long-term datasets, supporting both rollback in case of mistakes and the ability to analyze historical data points.
