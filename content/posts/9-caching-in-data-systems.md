**Caching** stores frequently accessed data in a high-speed layer, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch it from slower storage, which improves data access performance.

1. **How Caching Improves Performance**: Caching reduces latency by serving repeated requests from fast-access memory, such as RAM or SSDs, instead of hitting the database or slower storage systems. This minimizes load on primary data stores and enhances scalability.  
    *Example*: When a user requests the same report multiple times, the system retrieves it from the cache instead of recalculating the results from scratch.

2. **Local SSD Caching**: Using local SSDs for caching allows faster retrieval of frequently queried data compared to traditional disk-based systems. SSDs offer low latency, high throughput, and data persistence across system restarts, making them ideal for caching large datasets efficiently.  
    *Example*: A web application caching popular search results on local SSDs can serve users quicker, improving their experience by minimizing delays.

Caching is essential for optimizing data access speed, reducing system load, and ensuring scalability in data-heavy applications.
