As companies grow, they move through three stages of data maturity: **Starting with Data**, **Scaling with Data**, and **Leading with Data**.

### Stage 1: Starting with Data
At this stage, data efforts are just beginning. Processes are informal, and the goal is to show quick results. Data engineers do a little of everything, like building reports and basic pipelines.

**What to do**:

- Get buy-in from key stakeholders.
- Define simple data architectures.
- Focus on delivering quick wins to prove value.

**What to avoid**:

- Don't rush into advanced analytics or machine learning.
- Avoid overly complex solutions or custom tools too early.

### Stage 2: Scaling with Data
Here, data processes become more structured. Data engineers focus on specific tasks like managing pipelines or storage, and the company starts using automation.

**What to do**:

- Build scalable data architectures.
- Implement automation and DataOps practices.
- Plan for future growth and larger data volumes.

**What to avoid**:

- Don't adopt bleeding-edge technologies unless necessary.
- Avoid over-complicating systems with too many tools.

### Stage 3: Leading with Data
Now, data drives decision-making. Everything runs smoothly, and new data sources are easy to add. Engineers build custom tools for even greater efficiency.

**What to do**:

- Automate data pipelines and workflows.
- Focus on data governance, quality, and security.
- Build custom tools for a competitive advantage.

**What to avoid**:

- Avoid complacency. Keep improving and innovating.
- Don’t get distracted by expensive projects that don’t add value.
