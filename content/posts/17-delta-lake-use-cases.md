*Summary of section 5 of the [paper](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3411-armbrust.pdf).*

Delta Lake use cases span diverse data types, including **Change Data Capture (CDC)** logs from OLTP systems, application logs, time series data, graphs, aggregate tables, and even image or feature data for **machine learning (ML)**. Applications running over this data include **SQL workloads**, **business intelligence**, **streaming**, **data science**, and **graph analytics**.

Delta Lake often helps simplify enterprise data architectures by unifying workloads directly against cloud object stores and creating a “**lakehouse**” system that combines both data lake and transactional features. This allows workloads that traditionally required multiple specialized systems (e.g., message queues, data lakes, and warehouses) to be consolidated, reducing the need for multiple copies of data and complex ingest jobs.

### Data Engineering and ETL  
Many organizations are moving **ETL/ELT** and **data warehousing** workloads to the cloud, often integrating traditional data sources (e.g., OLTP systems) with much larger streams from modern sources (e.g., web traffic or IoT sensors). 

Delta Lake’s **ACID transactions**, **UPSERT/MERGE** support, and **time travel** features enable users to perform reliable ETL processes directly on the object store. This eliminates the need for a separate data lake and warehouse, reducing the time to make new data available for querying. Delta Lake’s support for both **SQL** and **programmatic APIs** (via Apache Spark) simplifies the creation of data engineering pipelines using a variety of tools.

This use case is prevalent across industries, including **financial services**, **healthcare**, and **media**, where organizations often expose their data to new workloads such as data science using **PySpark** or streaming queries via **Spark Structured Streaming**. With Delta Lake, these workloads can access the same data directly from the object store, reducing complexity and cost.

### Data Warehousing and BI  
Traditional **data warehouse** systems combine ETL/ELT capabilities with optimized tools for interactive queries and **business intelligence (BI)** workloads. These systems rely on **columnar storage formats**, **clustering**, **indexing**, fast storage hardware, and optimized query engines.

Delta Lake supports all these features directly in cloud object stores, thanks to its **columnar formats**, **data layout optimization**, **max-min statistics**, and **SSD caching**. This allows users to run ad-hoc queries and BI workloads on their **lakehouse** datasets, using SQL or popular BI software like **Tableau**. A key advantage of using Delta Lake for BI is the ability to provide analysts with **fresh data** immediately, without the need for loading it into a separate system.

These common use cases demonstrate how Delta Lake helps unify data architectures, simplify workflows, and deliver up-to-date data for various applications, from ETL pipelines to data warehousing and BI.
