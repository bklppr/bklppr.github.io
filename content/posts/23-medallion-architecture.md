The Medallion Architecture is a design pattern for organizing data in data lakes, helping manage raw and transformed data in a structured way.

### What is the Medallion Architecture?

The **Medallion Architecture** is a way of organizing data in stages, where each stage applies more refinement to the data.

#### Stages:
1. **Bronze Layer**: The raw, unprocessed data layer.
2. **Silver Layer**: The cleaned and transformed data.
3. **Gold Layer**: The final, business-ready data used for reporting and analysis.

This architecture is typically used in **data lakes** or **data lakehouses**, where large volumes of data are ingested from many sources. Each layer adds value to the data by improving its quality or preparing it for specific use cases.

### Bronze Layer: The Raw Data

- **Raw Data**: No transformation or cleaning has occurred. Data is stored as it is ingested.
- **Flexible and Fast Ingestion**: Data can be loaded quickly without requiring any pre-processing.
- **High Storage Volume**: Since all data is kept in its raw form, this layer typically holds the largest amount of data.

The Bronze Layer is used for **historical analysis** and **data retention**.

### Silver Layer: Cleaned and Transformed Data

- **Data Cleansing**: Data is cleaned to remove errors and inconsistencies.
- **Transformation**: Data is structured and normalized, making it easier to query.
- **Improved Quality**: The data is now more reliable and ready for further processing.

The Silver Layer is often used for **data exploration** and **machine learning**.

### Gold Layer: Business-Ready Data

- **Aggregated and Optimized**: Data is aggregated, filtered, and optimized for fast queries.
- **Business-Friendly Format**: Data is organized for easy use in business reports, dashboards, and analytics.
- **Reliable for Decision Making**: The Gold Layer is trusted data that can be used directly by decision-makers.

The Gold Layer is used by **business analysts** and **executives** who need fast, reliable access to insights for decision-making.
