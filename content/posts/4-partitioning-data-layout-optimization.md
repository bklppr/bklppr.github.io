**Partitioning** divides large datasets into smaller, more manageable segments based on specific attributes, improving query performance by limiting the amount of data scanned.

1. **Partitioning by Attributes**: Dividing data by commonly queried fields (e.g., date, region) helps systems skip irrelevant partitions, reducing query times.  
    *Example*: Partitioning sales data by `year` allows a query for 2023 data to skip older partitions entirely.

2. **Optimizing Data Layout**: Techniques such as adjusting file sizes and clustering related data enhance access speed and performance.  
    *Example*: Clustering data by geographic region enables faster retrieval of location-based queries.

Efficient partitioning and data layout optimization are critical for managing massive datasets and maintaining performance.
