### What are Delta Lake Shallow Clones?

A **shallow clone** in Delta Lake is a fast, lightweight copy of an existing Delta table. This clone only copies the **metadata** (such as schema, partitioning, and table configuration) of the original table while still referencing the **same data files** in the source table. Since the actual data files aren't duplicated, shallow clones are quick to create and don't require additional storage for the original data.

Any changes made to shallow clones affect only the clones themselves and not the source table, as long as they donâ€™t touch the source data Parquet files.
