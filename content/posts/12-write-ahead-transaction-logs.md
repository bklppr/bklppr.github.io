**Write-ahead transaction logs** (WAL) record every change before the actual data is updated, ensuring ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

1. **How Write-Ahead Logs Work**: WAL systems write changes to a separate log before committing them to the main database.
    - **Atomicity**: By logging all steps of a transaction first, WAL ensures that either the whole transaction is completed or none of it, rolling back incomplete operations if a failure occurs.
    - **Consistency**: Logs capture every valid state transition. If any constraints are violated, the log prevents invalid changes from being applied, ensuring consistent data states.
    - **Isolation**: WAL enforces transaction order, so concurrent transactions don't interfere. Even if multiple transactions run at the same time, the log ensures an orderly execution.
    - **Durability**: Once a transaction is written to the log and committed, it is safe from crashes. The log guarantees that committed transactions can be recovered.

2. **Crash Recovery Using WAL**: WAL simplifies crash recovery by replaying logs.  
    *Example*: After a system crash, the system replays the logs to complete or roll back transactions, ensuring no incomplete changes are left behind.

Write-ahead transaction logs provide a robust method for maintaining data integrity and simplifying recovery after system failures.
