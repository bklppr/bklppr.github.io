Ingesting data into large data lakes presents several challenges, including maintaining data freshness and managing concurrent updates efficiently.

1. **Challenges of Data Ingestion**: Handling high-volume, continuously generated data (whether in batches or real-time) requires systems to manage frequent updates, avoid bottlenecks, and ensure data integrity.  
    *Example*: A stock trading system processing thousands of transactions per second must keep its data consistent in real-time without slowing down the ingestion process.

2. **Techniques for Maintaining Fresh Data**:  
    - **UPSERT**: This operation either updates an existing record if a match is found or inserts a new record if there isnâ€™t. It typically replaces entire records.  
    *Example*: A retail system using UPSERT can update customer details or add new customers when data comes in.

    - **MERGE**: MERGE is more flexible than UPSERT. It allows conditional updates, partial updates of specific fields, inserts of new records, and even deletions based on conditions.  
    *Example*: In a customer database, a MERGE operation could update only the phone number of an existing customer while adding new customer records at the same time.

    - **DELETE**: This operation removes records that are no longer needed or contain errors.  
    *Example*: In a sensor network, DELETE can be used to remove outdated data, ensuring that only the latest readings are stored.

These techniques ensure that data is ingested smoothly, keeping the dataset fresh and accurate without compromising performance in both batch and streaming scenarios.
