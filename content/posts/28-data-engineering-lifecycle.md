The data engineering lifecycle refers to the process of turning raw data into useful products for analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. It can be broken down into five main stages:

### 1. Generation
This stage involves gathering data from source systems, such as IoT devices, applications, or databases. Understanding the data sources and how they generate data is key.

### 2. Storage
Data must be stored in a system that supports the volume, velocity, and variety of the data generated. Proper storage enables smooth transitions between the lifecycle stages.

### 3. Ingestion
Data is ingested into systems for further processing. This could involve pulling data from APIs or streaming it from devices. Reliable ingestion ensures data is available for the next steps.

### 4. Transformation
Data is transformed into a useful format through processes like cleaning, normalization, or aggregation. This step is where data starts becoming valuable for end users.

### 5. Serving
The final stage is serving the transformed data to end users, such as data analysts or machine learning models, for further analysis and decision-making.

These stages arenâ€™t always linear and may overlap or repeat. Supporting all these stages are key "undercurrents" like security, data management, and orchestration, ensuring the lifecycle runs efficiently.
