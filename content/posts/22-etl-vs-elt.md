ETL and ELT are two methods used to process and move data. They share similar goals but work in different ways. Understanding their differences is important when designing data systems.

### What is ETL?

**ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load)** is the traditional way of moving data. The data is first **extracted** from the source system, then **transformed** (cleaned and reorganized), and finally **loaded** into a data warehouse for analysis. ETL works well with structured data that needs to be ready for reporting and analysis.

#### ETL Process:
1. **Extract**: Data is taken from sources like databases or files.
2. **Transform**: The data is cleaned and changed to match the structure of the final system.
3. **Load**: The data is then moved to the target system, usually a data warehouse, for querying.

### What is ELT?

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** is a newer approach often used with **cloud data lakes**. In ELT, data is first **extracted**, then **loaded** into the target system without changing it, and finally **transformed** after itâ€™s in the system. The transformation is done when needed for analysis. ELT often relies on the processing power of cloud systems and can handle different types of data, including unstructured data like images or logs.

#### ELT Process:
1. **Extract**: Data is taken from its sources in raw form.
2. **Load**: Raw data is stored directly in a data lake or cloud warehouse.
3. **Transform**: Data is transformed inside the data lake or warehouse only when it is needed for analysis.
