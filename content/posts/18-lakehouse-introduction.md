*Summary of section 1 of the [paper](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf).*

The traditional **data warehouse** architecture is expected to be replaced by a new pattern called the **Lakehouse**, which combines the benefits of **data lakes** and **data warehouses**. A Lakehouse is characterized by:

1. **Open direct-access data formats** (e.g., Apache Parquet, ORC).
2. **First-class support for machine learning (ML) and data science** workloads.
3. **State-of-the-art performance**.

### Evolution of Data Architectures
**First Generation**:

- **Centralized Data Warehouses**: Focused on **centralizing data** from operational systems into data warehouses for **Business Intelligence (BI)** and reporting.
- **Schema-on-Write**: Employed a **schema-on-write** approach, meaning data was structured and optimized for downstream analysis before being stored in the warehouse.
- **On-Premises and Coupled Systems**: Typically coupled **compute and storage** into a single on-premises system or appliance, which required provisioning for peak load capacity.
- **Limited to Structured Data**: Primarily handled **structured data**, making it difficult to store or query unstructured data types like video, audio, and text documents.
- **Costly and Rigid**: Scaling was expensive, as enterprises had to pay for both **compute and storage** resources upfront, leading to high costs as datasets grew.

**Second Generation Systems**:

- **Storage Infrastructure**: Built on **on-premises systems** like Hadoop's HDFS, which provided large-scale, low-cost storage for data lakes.
- **Separation of Compute and Storage**: Introduced the concept of decoupling compute from storage but typically relied on **private data centers** or on-premise infrastructure.
- **Schema-on-Read**: Adopted a **schema-on-read** approach, allowing raw, unstructured data (e.g., logs, video, audio) to be stored first and processed later.
- **ETL Process**: Data was first loaded into the data lake, then later ETLed into a data warehouse (e.g., Teradata) for high-performance analytics and BI tasks.

**Current Cloud Systems**:

- **Storage Infrastructure**: Fully transitioned to **cloud-based** storage services like **Amazon S3**, **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**, and **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, offering superior scalability, durability, and geo-replication.
- **Fully Cloud-Native**: Unlike the second-generation systems, these systems are **fully cloud-native**, taking advantage of the cloud's pay-as-you-go model and seamless scalability.
- **Same Two-Tier Architecture**: Continue to follow the **two-tier architecture** where data is first stored in a cloud data lake and then ETLed into a data warehouse (e.g., Redshift, Snowflake) for analytics.
- **Advanced Durability and Lower Costs**: Provide significantly better durability (often >10 nines) and lower storage costs, including archival options like AWS Glacier, compared to on-premise solutions.

### Challenges of Current Architectures
Despite cost efficiency, the two-tier architecture has several drawbacks:

1. **Reliability**: Keeping the data lake and warehouse consistent requires ongoing engineering effort and introduces risks of data corruption.
2. **Data Staleness**: Data in warehouses is often stale, leading to delayed insights and outdated analytics.
3. **Limited Support for Advanced Analytics**: Modern use cases, like machine learning, require large datasets and complex processing, which traditional warehouses donâ€™t handle well.
4. **High Total Cost of Ownership**: Maintaining separate storage and compute systems increases costs, including data duplication and ETL overhead.

### The Promise of Lakehouse Architecture
The **Lakehouse** aims to unify the best of both data lakes and warehouses by:

- **Reliable data management**: Systems like **Delta Lake** and **Apache Iceberg** bring transactional consistency, versioning, and advanced data management to data lakes.
- **Support for ML and data science**: Direct access to data lake formats and optimized **DataFrame APIs** allow Lakehouses to efficiently support machine learning and data science workloads.
- **SQL Performance**: Advanced techniques and optimizations, such as auxiliary data and optimized layouts, enable SQL performance on par with traditional warehouses over Parquet and ORC datasets.

The Lakehouse design addresses the challenges of data warehousing and enables new possibilities for modern data-driven applications.
