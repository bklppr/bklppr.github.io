Cloud object stores like **Amazon S3** and **Azure Blob Storage** are widely used due to their scalability and pay-as-you-go model, making them ideal for managing large datasets in **data warehouses** and **data lakes**. 

Many open-source systems (e.g., **Apache Spark**, **Hive**) and commercial platforms (e.g., **AWS Athena**, **Google BigQuery**) support these stores using file formats like **Parquet** and **ORC**. However, object stores, unlike distributed filesystems, function as key-value stores with no cross-object consistency, leading to challenges with **data consistency**, **atomic writes**, and **performance**.

Storing relational datasets as objects (e.g., Parquet files) can work for simple queries, but complex workloads struggle due to non-atomic multi-object updates and expensive metadata operations, especially for large tables. 

**Enterprise datasets**, which are continuously updated, face challenges related to **atomic updates**, **privacy regulations** (e.g., **GDPR**), and the repair of incorrect data.

**Delta Lake** was designed to address the challenges of managing data in cloud object stores by providing an **ACID-compliant** table storage layer. It uses a **write-ahead log** stored in the cloud to maintain data consistency and ensure atomic updates. 

The data itself is stored in Parquet format, allowing for high-performance parallel reads and writes. Delta Lake also optimizes **metadata management**, enabling faster searches. Transactions are managed using **optimistic concurrency control**, which eliminates the need for always-on servers and allows users to scale compute and storage separately.

Delta Lake's transactional design enables several advanced features not available in traditional cloud data lakes, addressing key pain points. These include:

- **Time travel**, which allows querying past snapshots or rolling back updates
- Operations like **UPSERT**, **DELETE**, and **MERGE** to efficiently update data and comply with regulations like GDPR
- Support for efficient **streaming I/O**, enabling real-time data ingestion with small objects, which are later combined for performance
- **Caching** for faster reads
- **Data layout optimization** using **Z-ordering**
- **Schema evolution** without rewriting old data
- **Audit logging**

Together, these features make Delta Lake a unified solution that combines the functionality of both data warehouses and data lakes, simplifying architectures and improving performance.
