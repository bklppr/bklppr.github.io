A **schema** defines the structure of a database, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships between them. **Schema evolution** refers to the ability of a system to accommodate changes in this structure over time. This is critical for long-lived datasets, where new requirements may necessitate changes to the schema.

1. **Adding Columns**: When new data becomes available, new columns can be added without disrupting existing queries.  
    *Example*: Adding a “last_login” field to track user activity without affecting previous records.

2. **Modifying Columns**: Adjustments to column data types or constraints may be necessary as data requirements evolve.  
    *Example*: Changing a "birthdate" column from a `string` to a `date` type for better validation and querying.

3. **Deleting Columns**: When certain data is no longer needed, columns can be dropped without affecting other parts of the schema.  
    *Example*: Removing an outdated “fax_number” field from a customer table.

In **distributed systems** (networks of computers working together to achieve a common goal), schema evolution allows teams to iteratively improve and scale data models while keeping systems operational. Without this flexibility, long-lived datasets would be prone to data corruption or rigid designs, making them difficult to maintain and update over time.
