**Log-based storage** maintains a transaction log that records all operations on data, ensuring ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) by storing a sequential log of changes.

1. **Log-Based Storage and ACID Compliance**: Log-based storage ensures ACID properties through its structured handling of transactions:
    - **Atomicity**: The log helps achieve this by storing all the transaction steps; if a failure occurs, the log ensures incomplete transactions are rolled back.
    - **Consistency**: Logs ensure that the system moves from one valid state to another. Any transaction that violates constraints is rolled back, and the log ensures that only valid, consistent changes are committed.
    - **Isolation**: By maintaining a sequential transaction log, log-based systems can ensure that transactions are isolated from each other. If multiple transactions occur concurrently, the log enforces an order, preventing them from interfering with one another.
    - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are logged and preserved, even if the system crashes. The log ensures that committed transactions are recoverable.  

2. **Role of Checkpoints**: Checkpoints reduce the need to manage large amounts of metadata by periodically writing snapshots of the database state to disk. By doing so, they limit the number of logs that need to be replayed during recovery, improving system performance and reducing recovery time.  
    *Example*: Instead of replaying a yearâ€™s worth of transaction logs after a crash, a system with regular checkpoints can restart from the latest checkpoint and apply only the most recent logs, minimizing downtime.

Log-based storage, combined with periodic checkpoints, ensures data reliability while optimizing system recovery and reducing the overhead of managing transactional metadata.
